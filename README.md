Apprentice Learning Resources & Pathway
=======================================

This repository collects online resources (both from within and beyond HMRC) for new apprentices joining the tax platform in devops roles.

What's inside
-------------
There are four kinds of content in here.


### Projects
These are long

### Inductions
These sessions introduce an element of the history and context of the tax platform and HMRC, rather than teaching a particular skill. This includes ways of working, what teams do, etc.

### Resources
A mixture of online tutorials and signposts to relevant external training opportunities (eg. GDS community organised training).

### Bookmarks
It's tough to remember URLs. Ease your onboarding experience with a ready-made list of URLs to our tools.
