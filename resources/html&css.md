HTML & CSS
==========

Tutorials and other resources for learning semantic HTML markup and responsive CSS.

* [Wes Box flexbox course](https://flexbox.io/). Free, culminates in creating a mobile app layout, so ties in well with our 'Build a Web App' project.
* [Sass (an extension of CSS)](http://sass-lang.com/). So essentially this is a much simpler way to write CSS. Once finished it can be converted into CSS by ['compiling' it- I got talked into downloading compass by the installation instructions I was following...](http://compass.kkbox.com/). Installation process is a little complicated (I installed rvm, then the newest version of Ruby-2.4.1, then installed Sass and Compass) but seems to be a very good way of doing CSS in the future. I'd recommend doing the codeacademy course which makes it a *lot* clearer :)
