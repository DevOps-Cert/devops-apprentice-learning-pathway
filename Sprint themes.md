Sprint themes
=============

*team-apprentice* will be organised around two-week agile sprints, beginning and ending on Wednesdays.

Each sprint will contain a mixture of technical project work (delivered via 20% supervised workshops, 80% unsupervised pair/individual working), shadowing and research.

One *large project* will take up nearly half of apprentices' time per sprint, and will last for at least three sprints. *Medium projects* will last two sprints or less, and *small projects* will last less than one sprint.

Each sprint will be *themed*. This is a topic or skill which apprentices should learn about and understand by the sprint's end. This may involve online research, shadowing or receiving workshops from specialist staff working on the platform, or completing tutorials.

Project work will also be tied in with the sprint theme where possible.

1: Agile working
----------------

This sprint will formally introduce the concept of agile working, specifically as a contrast to the traditional waterfall style in government.

The specific systems of Scrum and Kanban will be compared.

Tools to facilitate agile working (Jira, Trello, CI/CD) will be walked through.

2: DevOps
---------

Apprentices will be introduced to the concepts of webops and devops, and the problems these practices solve (i.e. 'throwing over the wall').

They will come to a greater understanding of the role of a devops engineer, the skills the role needs and the stakeholders/customers of our work.

Tools used by devops engineers will be walked through.

3: Testing
----------

This sprint introduces the concepts of test and behaviour driven development.

Different kinds of testing will be considered (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests) etc.

Testing tools and frameworks will be introduced.
