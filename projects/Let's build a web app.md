#Let's build a web app
This is a project intended to teach the fundamentals of user-centred design, front and back end web development, database and server administration.

Apprentices will conceptualise, design and build a simple yet working web application from scratch.

##Skills targeted
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Bash
* Source control
* Linux administration
* Information security

##Delivery
The project is intended to take place through weekly practical workshops of about three hours, plus around a day's time working independently on the topics covered in the workshop.

##Modules
### 1. User-centred design
This module introduces apprentices to the concept of user needs and business needs, plus the value of user research. Apprentices will "imagine" some user needs for the sake of the exercise, map out possible user journeys and eventually create several iterations of wireframes for the application.

The concept of responsive design is also briefly introduced.

### 2. How the web works
This module introduces the server-client relationship, the structure of URLs and the HTTP protocol, including possible response codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 5xx). There is no practical component, but it is necessary background for later workshops.

### 3. HTML/CSS
In this module, apprentices will work to create prototypes of their wireframes from module 1, first using the online IDE [Codepen](http://codepen.io) and eventually with the [Atom](http://atom.io) code editor.

The development concept of **separating concerns** is introduced through the distinction between HTML and CSS. The concept of **readable, maintainable code** is introduced through asking apprentices to use well-structured, semantic HTML and avoiding the use of `!important` in CSS.

Apprentices will end up with a HTML & CSS prototype for each screen of their application.
