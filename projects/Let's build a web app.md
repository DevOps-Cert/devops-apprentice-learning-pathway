Let's build a web app
======================
This is a project intended to teach the fundamentals of user-centred design, front and back end web development, database and server administration.

Apprentices will conceptualise, design and build a simple yet working web application from scratch.

Skills developed
----------------
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* REST APIs
* Bash
* Source control
* Linux administration
* Information security
* Test-driven development

Delivery
---------
The project is intended to take place through weekly practical workshops of about three hours, plus around a day's time working independently on the topics covered in the workshop.

Modules
---------
### 1. User-centred design
This module introduces apprentices to the concept of **user needs** and business needs, plus the value of user research. Apprentices will "imagine" some user needs for the sake of the exercise, map out possible user journeys and eventually create several iterations of wireframes for the application.

The concept of **responsive design** is also briefly introduced.

### 2. How the web works
This module introduces the **server-client relationship**, the structure of URLs and the **HTTP protocol**, including possible response codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 5xx). There is no practical component, but it is necessary background for later workshops.

### 3. HTML/CSS
In this module, apprentices will work to create prototypes of their wireframes from module 1, first using the online IDE [Codepen](http://codepen.io) and eventually with the [Atom](http://atom.io) code editor.

The development concept of **separating concerns** is introduced through the distinction between HTML and CSS. The concept of **readable, maintainable code** is introduced through asking apprentices to use well-structured, semantic HTML and avoiding the use of `!important` in CSS.

Inspecting the markup and styles of existing websites using browser dev tools is introduced.

Apprentices will end up with a HTML & CSS prototype for each screen of their application.

### 4. Source control
This module introduces the need for **source and version control**, especially for developers working in teams. Apprentices install git and learn several basic git commands (`git commit`, `git push`). They also learn the concept of remotes, and connect their local git repository to a Github repository.

At the end of this module, the prototype HTML & CSS files we have so far will live in a Github repo.

### 5. Javascript
In this module, we introduce the first *real* programming language - javascript. Using Codepen, Apprentices learn the programming concepts of types, variables, comparison operators, if and for loops.

At the end of this module, apprentices have added some simple interactivity to their application, using a click event listener to add and remove a class from some markup, and therefore change its appearance.

Outside workshops, apprentices are guided independently through adding all necessary client-side JS to their prototypes.

### 6. Node.js & test-driven development
Here, we introduce the concept of javascript running on the server, along with writing some simple unit tests for the code they write.

Apprentices will install Node, NPM and the testing framework Jasmine.
