Let's build a web app ...in AWS
=========================
This is the successor to the earlier web application project. Here, apprentices will iterate upon their existing product, identifying opportunities to make use of Amazon Web Services and refactoring the application accordingly.

Skills developed
----------------
* Primary
  * Linux administration
  * Software & API design
  * Bash
* Secondary
  * Source control
  * Continuous integration & deployment

Delivery
--------
The project should be delivered via hourly catchup meetings, but all technical work should be done in supervised pairs.

Modules
-------
### 1. What improvements can we make?
As preparation for this session, all team members should have completed an online AWS essentials course, to understand the products on offer.

A guided discussion should determine:
1. Which two applications we shall carry forward, of the four we have developed
2. What are the biggest problems, or likely future problems, with these applications
3. What AWS features can we incorporate to alleviate these issues

### 2-4. Catchups
Review code written so far. Discuss progress made and problems encountered. Plan the next iteration as needed.

Potential iterations could focus on:
* Run code on AWS EC2 instances rather than in Heroku
* Use Amazon RDS rather than a MongoDB database
* Use Amazon S3 for file storage
* Use Lambda functions for background file upload processing tasks
