It's getting cold in here
=========================

This project will see apprentices build an automated temperature-logging system with a web frontend.

Apprentices will learn to access USB devices with their programming language of choice, log data from them to a database, and eventually send that data to a remote server, which makes it publicly available on a web frontend.

This project is **deliberately open-ended**, so that apprentices are free to iterate the product as they feel is appropriate to meet user needs.

Skills developed
----------------
* Primary
  * Linux administration
  * Software & API design
  * Node.js
  * Bash
* Secondary
  * Source control
  * Test-driven development
  * Continuous integration & deployment
  * HTML/CSS

Delivery
--------
The project should be delivered via four hourly catchup meetings, but all technical work should be done in unsupervised pairs, with assistance available from mentors if needed.

Modules
-------
### 1. The problem to be solved & architecture
First, consider the problem to be solved and collect user needs associated with it.

Guided discussion will culminate in the creation of a high-level architecture diagram of the **minimum viable product**.

The team will be split into pairs with different focuses.

### 2-4. Catchups
Review the codebase of the project. Discuss progress made and potential improvements, with reference to the original user needs. Plan the next iteration.

Potential future iterations could include:
* Add automated alerts if readings drop below a threshold
* Add basic user authentication for the web client
* Deploying to an AWS EC2 instance rather than to Heroku
* Use Docker containers rather than bare Linux.
* Rely less on local databases and use Amazon's RDS service.
